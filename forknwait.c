   This C program is intended to illustrate how to fork a process and how to wait for the child.  How to wait for the child is much
   more involved than simply calling the wait system call.  This is because the wait call can return for many reasons.
   
   To make applications more portable it is preferable not to use our special knowledge of the high/low order 8 bit quantities in
   the 16 bit return from wait.  Instead we can use the POSIX macros to do the same thing.  I have sprinkled comments in the code
   discussing the do-it yourself methods and the POSIX methods.
