This repo contains a few programs I wrote long ago to help my students
in an introduction to UNIX programming class.  Some of the interfaces have
changed over the years, but a surprising amount of this content is still
useful.

You can read a bit more about these examples on my [home page](https://www.mitchr.me/SS/exampleCode/AUPG.html).

Have fun!
