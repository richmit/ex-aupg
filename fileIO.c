   @brief     UNIX I/O routines@EOL
   @Keywords  UNIX file I/O
   @Std       ISOC POSIX UNIX98
   @Tested    
              - Solaris 2.8
              - MacOS X.2
              - Linux (RH 7.3)

   Two general approaches are taken for file I/O in C on a UNIX platform: UNIX I/O and ANSI/ISO C I/O.  This program demonstrates
   the UNIX I/O routines.  It is important not to mix ANSI/ISO C I/O with UNIX I/O on the same file.  This will hopelessly confuse
   your program.  Functions exist in the UNIX library to let you do this, but it is best to simply avoid the mess.  On a side note,
   do not mix C++ I/O with UNIX or ANSI/ISO C I/O.  Again, methods exist to make this work, but it is best to simply pick an I/O
   library and stick to it. :)
  
   Most UNIX I/O functions can error with an EINTR error.  In general if this error is seen, the function should be re-attempted.
   This code doesn't demonstrate this.  Also this code doesn't demonstrate the complete behavior of of the write call with respect
   to partial success.  Both of these interesting problems are tackled in the example program called IOerrors.c.  The approach taken
   in this code is typical of file I/O found in many UNIX programs.  The more exotic error handling found in IOerrors.c is normally
   only seen in network programs.

     function fseek.  We will use this function to "rewind" the filepointer so that we can reread the file from the start.  This
