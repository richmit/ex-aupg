# @brief     an rsh work alike@EOL
# @Keywords  perl TCP/IP rsh UNIX
# @Std       Perl5
#
# Any UNIX admin that considers security at even the most basic level should take a close look at a text that describes basic TCP/IP
# protocols used for UNIX.  In particular, any good UNIX admin should take a close look at the protocols used by the "r"-commands.
#
# This perl script is intended to illistrate just how simple rsh(2) realy is.  Note, that the network protocol simply has the user
# id and the command being sent to the remote host.  Then the remote host sends the results back.  Not a very good idea in our
# dangerous world.
#
# The complexity in the script given is intended to provide an example of how to make a perl script timeout and exit gracefully even
# in the face of network protocols that can just hang forever.  The script is a good basis for a custom rsh that can be used as a
# more robust version than the one supplied by most OS venders.  One can achieve the same effect by putting an alarm in a perl
# script and using the OS version of rsh.  The only disadvantage of this approach is that the rsh can be left hanging around from
# such a program.  By rolling your own version of rsh in a perl script you can avoid shelling out, and you can cleanly handle
# errors.  As an additional advantage, you can take different actions based upon where in the script the problem occurs.
